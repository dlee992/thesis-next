End-user programming has gained widespread attention and applications, among which, spreadsheets are undoubtedly one of the most popular programming paradigms in end-user programming.
% Spreadsheets are widely accepted by users and are widely used worldwide. 
They are usually used to store, calculate, and analyze user data. 
For example, software such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheet provides users with the convenience of calculating formulas and making decisions. 
However, there are indeed various types of errors and defects hidden in every spreadsheet. 
In the past twenty years, some companies have caused billions of dollars in economic losses since they made mistakes when using spreadsheets.

Therefore, the use of software engineering technology to help end users detect potential defects in spreadsheets has received widespread attention. 
A variety of technologies has been proposed to detect errors and defects in spreadsheets. 
Representative existing work can be roughly divided into two categories based on technical ideas: rule-based and clustering/learning-based technologies. 
The former (e.g., CACheck) can usually detect specific types of cell defects with high accuracy according to the precise rules of the design, but the recall rate of the detection is not high relative to the latter.
The latter (e.g., CUSTODES) classifies cells according to the strong features of cell formulas and weak features of cell layouts, thereby greatly improving the detection recall rate. 
However, compared with the former, the complexity of the spreadsheet itself leads to inaccurate feature extraction. 
Therefore, the final detection accuracy is not high. 

Taking into account the above shortcomings, in this work we propose a novel technology \wa , based on \cu's innate adaptive cross-table, cross-layout style learning ability, but improve it during mixing the relevant and irrelevant cells into the same cluster. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Proposing the spreadsheet defect detection technology WARDER, focusing on the validity properties of the cells and the clusters formed to refine the cell clustering process of CUSTODES, and effectively improve the effectiveness of the spreadsheet defect detection as a whole;
    \item Using an existing spreadsheet benchmark and a large-scale spreadsheet corpus, WARDER was fully tested and evaluated, and compared with other most popular spreadsheet defect detection technologies;
    \item Implementing two visualization tools: a Java-based visualization tool SGuard, which can compare the detection results of a variety of mainstream technologies; another JavaScript-based Excel plug-in EGuard, using that, you can see instantly and step by step see the detection results of the current opened spreadsheet, which is convenient for users to confirm and repair formula defects immediately.
\end{enumerate}
